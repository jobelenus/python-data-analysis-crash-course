Thats great if you have tabular data.  I am instead going to feed you with a netCDF4 file, which takes a little bit more work to load, but only a few lines.  Ping me if you get stuck.\n",

The data spans from January 1880 through January 2019, though spatial coverage is sparse at the earlier dates and gets much better with time.\n",
