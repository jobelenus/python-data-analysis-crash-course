    "- Three players per game\n",
    "- Players are choosing and answering questions from a 5x6 (30 question) board\n",
    "- Each question is worth some amount of money. If they answer correctly that money is added to their total score, if they answer incorrectly that money is subtracted\n",
    "- The game is divided into three components or \"rounds\"\n",
    "    - Round 1: Questions on the board worth \\$200-\\$1000\n",
    "    - Round 2: Questions on the board worth \\$400-\\$2000\n",
    "    - Final Jeopardy: (\"round 3\" in the data) All players with a positive score make a wager on a single question.\n",
    "- Occasionally a chosen question is revealed to be a \"Daily Double\" at which point the player can make a wager and only that player can answer the question  \n",

    "### About the Data\n",
    "This data is obtained from J! Archive (j-archive.com) and covers a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings#Streak_on_Jeopardy!\">very particular set of 75 games</a> between June 2, 2004 and Nov 30, 2004.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four CSV files:\n",
    " - <b>games.csv</b>\n",
    "     - gameId: Unique ID for that game used by j-archive. You can view full game data at http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=<gameId\\>\n",
    "     - date: Date the game was broadcast\n",
    "     \n",
    " - <b>scores.csv</b>\n",
    "     - gameId: (see above)\n",
    "     - playerId: Unique ID for that player used by j-archive. You can view full player data at http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=<playerId\\>\n",
    "     - breakScore: Score at the first commercial break\n",
    "     - round1: Score after round 1\n",
    "     - round2: Score after round 2\n",
    "     - final: Score after Final Jeopardy question (round 3)\n",
    "     - coryat: An adjusted score that disregards the effect of wagering (https://j-archive.com/help.php#coryatscore). Used only for analysis purposes, is not an official game score or used in the game in any way\n",
    "     \n",
    "- <b>questions.csv</b>\n",
    "    - gameId: (see above)\n",
    "    - round: There are two rounds in Jeopardy. Final Jeopardy question is denoted as round '3'\n",
    "    - pickorder: The order the questions were chosen by players during that round. Final Jeopardy question has value '0'. Note that to get the order questions were picked in throught the <i>game</i> you need to sort by round and then pickorder\n",
    "    - amount: Amount the question was worth. In the case of Daily Double questions (where a single player wagers an amount of their choosing) this amount is set to what they wagered. In Final Jeopardy the amount is always 0. Players can make different wagers here, so look up their score and do some math if you need this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>answers.csv</b>\n",
    "    - questionId: Unique ID from the questions file\n",
